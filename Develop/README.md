# Professional README Generator
  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache-yellow.svg)    

  
  ## Description
  The application will generate a Professional README by simply answering the questions. This application is made to speed up the process of making a professional README file. With most of the work already completed, all the user has to do is to answer the questions and the rest is done. I learned a lot on this project and I had a lot of fun making something that I can use.
